  Hey there! Iâ€™m a Web Developer and Designer from Mandya, India!
</p>

 I enjoy taking complex problems. I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether it be PHP, MySql, GIT, HTML, CSS, jQuery, frameworks or new technologies. 

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

*  Working with a passion for developing great websites with very good performance & designing beautiful and functional user experiences.
*  Minimalist who believes that less is more.
