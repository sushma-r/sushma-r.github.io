<p class="message">
   Iâ€™m a Developer & Web Artisan from Mandya, India!
</p>

I enjoy solving complex problems. I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code, whether it be in PHP, MySql, HTML, CSS, jQuery, frameworks or any other technologies. I mainly work with PHP, LAMP stack and related technologies. My interests lie in working with open source technologies and building excellent applications.

I have a passion for developing great websites with good performance & designing beautiful and functional user experiences. A minimalist who believes that less is more.
