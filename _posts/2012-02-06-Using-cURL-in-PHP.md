title: Using cURL in PHP
---

curl_init() is used to make a connection to a web page and retrieve its data. 

```
$c = curl_init();
```

Now with curl_setopt() function to specify the connection settings. The most important setting is the target URL. Call the function as follows, with CURLOPT_URL as the option name and the last argument the desired URL:

```
curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.google.com/");
```

One of these features is including the HTTP header with the output. We can turn it off as follows:

```
curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
```

cURL automatically prints the accessed page instead of returning it as a string. We need a string if we intend to analyze the page somehow, so use the CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER option to say that we want the output as a string:

```
curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
```

We are now ready to access the page with the curl_exec() function:

```
$page_data = curl_exec($c);
```

Finally, we close the connection with curl_close():

```
curl_close($c);
```
