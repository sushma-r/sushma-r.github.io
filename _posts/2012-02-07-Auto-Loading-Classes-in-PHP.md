title: Auto Loading Classes in PHP
---

__autoload() function is used to load the classes automatically on the fly. When the parser has the trouble to find a perticular class, it automatically searches for it in __autoload function. Using this function we can get rid of redundant require / include statements as explained below.

```
//File Name : User.php
class User{
    function getName(){
        return "Nandeesh Mp";
    }
}
 ```

Lets assume that we are having a User class in a seperate file called User.php. One way to load this class is by calling the statement require_once 'User.php' as shown below.

```
// File Name : index.php
require_once 'User.php';
$user = new User();  //
echo $user->getName();
``` 

Suppose if we want to load five different classes, using the above method we will have to manually load them using five require_once statements. By using the __autoload() function we can get rid of redundant require_once statements and load classes automatically.


```
// File Name : index.php
function __autoload($className){
    require_once $className.'.php';
}
$user = new User();  //
``` 

When the parser executes line 6 and finds that class User() has not been defined, it immediately goes in search for it in __autoload($callName) and loads User() class using the statement in the line 3.
