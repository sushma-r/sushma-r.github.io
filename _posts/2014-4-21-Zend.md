title: Its all about Zend Framework
---

Zend is an open source framework for building faster and robust web application and services. It follows the SOLID object oriented design principle and utilises most of the new features, namely namespaces, late static binding, lambda functions and closures.

*  Design - 'use-at-will' : Here each component is designed with few dependencies on other components, this loosely coupled architecture allows us to use whichever components we want and hence it is called as 'use-at-will' design.

* High Productivity : It has used a consistent set of coding patterns and practices and generally acknowledged best practices for writing efficient, reliable, and high-performing software are taken into account.

* Flexible Architecture : A 'flexible' environment is one in which we can manipulate our file systems and web server configurations as needed to achieve the most ideal project structure to run and secure our application.

* Extreme Simplicity : Module system design is simple and we can manage different objects with different methods for functions.	
	
* Supported by more than 300 contributor, include IBM and other major companies.
